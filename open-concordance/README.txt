Open Concordance aims to be an easy to use concordance software and text and corpus analysis tool.

REQUIREMENTS

Open Concordance requires the Python 3 interpreter to run. You can get it for free at http://www.python.org/.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

The Open Concordance Folder contains 4 source files, two of which are of real interest to users. 
To launch Open Concordance, simply run gui.py. A window will appear, with an empty concordance output window. First open your corpus folder using the option provided in the File menu. Please note that your folder must contain only .txt files for the program to be able to open it.
Advanced users can use the file corpus.py as a python module. corpus.py currently contains many features not implemented in the main program.

The other files are:
filetools.py: I used it for my own corpus research project, mostly formating.
generator.py: creates a corpus for testing purposes.
